# Changelog DBCO

## Version 0.1 - Week 42
Although this version is still missing some vital things the design shows how some of the fundational flows could work. The GGD can request contactdetails and provide users the ability to share instructions with their contacts that have been at risk.

Our focus for the next version:
- What if you don't have an access code and would like to use the app prior to being on the phone with someone from the GGD
- How could the app support the user to reconstruct who they have met while they have been contagious
