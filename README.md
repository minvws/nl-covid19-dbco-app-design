# COVID-19 Digitaal Bron en Contactonderzoek

## Introduction
This repository contains user research insights and the UX design of the Dutch COVID-19 app to support the manual contact tracing process (Digitaal Bron- en contactonderzoek).

## Important
* Please take the time to read the documentation before asking a question or give suggestions
* We will do our utmost best to read all of the comments and suggestions. However, we may not be able to reply to all of them
* After the launch of the app, the design will be changed less often

## Design & Contribution process

If you plan to make non-trivial changes, we recommend to open an issue beforehand where we can discuss your planned changes.
This increases the chance that we might be able to use your contribution (or it avoids doing work if there are reasons why we wouldn't be able to use it).

If you want to actively contribute to the design via comments or your own design suggestions, request access to the read-only Figma. Send a DM to [@emieljanson](https://www.twitter.com/emieljanson) with your email address for access

For the content published in this repository on GitHub, you can comment and make suggestions via GitHub. Note that all commits should be signed using a gpg key.

In [this Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Vndv3EXiJDQ98livrJJcaT/Public-App2-Digitale-ondersteuning-bron-en-contactonderzoek?node-id=0%3A1) we share the latest version of the designs. 

The ‘page’ with the highest number is the latest version. For each version, there is a [changelog](https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-dbco-app-design/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) available where we list the changes made since the previous version.
Each version contains the comments and answers posted for that version.
