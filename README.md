# COVID-19 Digitaal Bron en Contactonderzoek

## Introduction
This repository contains user research insights and the UX design of the Dutch COVID-19 app to support the manual contact tracing process (Digitaal Bron- en contactonderzoek).

## Design & Contribution process

If you plan to make non-trivial changes, we recommend to open an issue beforehand where we can discuss your planned changes.
This increases the chance that we might be able to use your contribution (or it avoids doing work if there are reasons why we wouldn't be able to use it).

Note that all commits should be signed using a gpg key.
